Another update, maybe getting even a little bit more tired. We're starting to see some weakness develop more internally and we're still positive in the short, intermediate, and long term, even though in the long term we're still in a downtrend. And there's been a real shift. Then you have a lot of folks that like they don't like to but they think they're arriving at the right time when really at least in the short term they might be getting a little near the end of the party for right now. But we've kind of thought that all week. And so you're seeing some FOMO, fear of missing out that's going on. People like, \"Oh my gosh, why didn't I get in two weeks ago when things were near a bottom?\" Well, you don't know that at the time. And think about the emotions that people are going through in the markets. They're not really sure what's happening. There's a lot of variables out there with the tariffs and the trade wars and things that are going on that we we didn't know the answers to those things and the market reacts to that. Well, we've been seeing a real improvement, but now as I go through the chart, you'll see this. There's at least some weakness starting to come in a little bit. Okay. So just going over right at the open, we had a lower open below S1. The futures were actually negative, but we've been seeing, and this is rather encouraging, most of the recovery actually happening during market hours. When we were going down, a lot of the gaps were happening not during market hours. You had the futures that were usually going lower at that time. And then we would open up and we wouldn't see that big of a move during the day. and it would largely come from a gap lower. Example for Thursday is we actually were looking negative but then we saw buying coming in. So we opened below S1 at 5874. We had been dealing with the 5900 level for right now anyway. It looks like we're above that level. So if we do come back down, what was once resistance now could likely become support. But then we climbed above the daily pivot at 58.90, still below 5900. We went positive above the unchanged level. Made it up to R1. This is when we broke above 5900. Then we hit resistance at R2. And please, every day I post the intraday pivot points on the YouTube community tab. And that we knew this ahead of time. This R2 was already on the chart. So please feel free to check those out. That was at 59.25 25 and that was where we set the high for the day. Then we declined from that. We went back down to R1. We chopped above and below R1 and then we closed a little bit above R1. So we were up 41% on below average volume. That's also something that we're seeing a it had been picking up a little bit. Now volume is starting to drop off. So we are positive in the short, intermediate, and long term. When you look at where we're at in relation to the 20, 50, and 200 day moving averages, interest rates did come down, and that gave some support to stocks. We were getting up above that 4.5% level, and we're still going to watch that. When we I have a chart that I follow of the 10-year yield that I'll show later on. And when we get above 4 and a.5%, that's when the market gets a little jittery about interest rates. So, the fact that they came down is pretty encouraging. We had some more take on inflation. I'll go through that with the PPI report. We had CPI coming out. Then we also had PPI coming out. Retail sales. It was a pretty heavy week as far as economic reports. And earning season is pretty much finished for right now, at least for the bulk of companies that report. And of course, President Trump is over in the Middle East and talking things and doing things. The people that love him think he's doing the right thing. the people that hate him think that he's doing a terrible job. But again, that's more emotionally based rather than being factual. Whether you like him or hate him, it's it's what's going on right now. And we try to sift through the emotional part and say, \"Okay, this is good. This is bad.\" So anyway, okay. So some comments, the mega cap, semiconductors, and growth, they did underperform on Thursday. And this is where we're seeing some of the weakness coming in. they were helping to lead things a little bit more to the upside and we need th these areas to stay strong if we're going to keep going up on a short-term basis. a pretty long list. Right now, we're looking extreme when we look at the 20 period exponential moving average of the S&P and then the usual charts. Stoke RSI, wins percent R, CCI 1420, and stochastics. Those are usually always on this list whenever we're going up or down. It just shows that there's with using different indicators that there's some conviction either to the upside or the downside. And also that we don't see on this list very often because we've been moving pretty quickly. Now the last couple of days we haven't we've been under 1% moves, but looking back over the last 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days, we've moved pretty quickly. That's what the rate of change charts attempt to measure. We're still far away from the 20 period moving average. The slope oscillator continues to be extreme positive. The short-term RSI is extreme positive. And then we're getting back to extreme again with the 20 period moving average study of those stocks inside the S&P intermediate term. We still have the CMBB composite. We're still up in the plus three channel with the standard deviation chart. The Aroon indicator now it's bumping back up and looking extreme. The PMO studies, the TTM squeeze still really really extreme there. And the bullish percent indexes for the S&P and NASDAQ 100 even though we're actually turning negative. This is one of the weakness areas that we're seeing. We're coming down with the S&P 500 bullish percent index and it's starting to drop below its moving average on an up day. So, that's part of the weakness that I'm talking about. I'll show you that chart as well. And then we're also far away from the 50 period moving average. No change to the overall scenario as it applies to the Fed. And then the dollar was down. We're still above 100, but we did decline. Interest rates were down. We came back under that 4 and a.5% level where after Thursday, excuse me, after Wednesday we were at 4.53%. We dropped down to 4.46% there. Sentiment is still positive. Not moving all that much. We actually ticked down a notch on an up day where we had been at 70, we came down to 69 and now we are in a new nonconfirmed trend. That just means that we've gone above the moving average with the ADX, but we're still below 20 and it's positive because the green line is above the red line. And I'll again I'll show you the chart of that with the update where our bias is positive and our momentum is positive. So we had a just a slew of economic reports. Probably the most influential one was PPI. It came in down half a percent. And that was the weak part. They expected it to be up.3%. The interesting thing is we're we're keeping more of an eye on past numbers and how they're being revised. The last time we had the PPI report, it was down4%. Okay. Well, they revised that up to unchanged. That could spark some inflation concerns there. Then this is what we call the core PPI. When you take out food and energy, of course, the things you have to have and but they're considered to be more volatile. So they take that out of the calculation. It was down 4%. They expected it to be up.3%. So again this was weaker than expected. The market liked that. But when you look at the previous report it was revised being up4% where the initial report that we had it was up.1%. This is more inflationary at the producer level. On a year-over-year basis we're looking at 2.4% 4% growth with the PPI where the last time the annual figure was 3.4%. That got revised up from 2.7%. Now to have growth here, that's a good thing. But to have growth in this type of an environment that could end up being inflationary and it really hasn't been passed on, at least yet to the consumer price index, which we received earlier in the week. So this could have spooked the markets, but it didn't. Folks are more in a euphoric type attitude right now. When you take out food and energy, this is more the the inflation part. They came in at 3.1% annualized and where the last time it came in at 3.3%. Now it got revised up to 4%. This could cause some problems, but it didn't in Thursday's session. Total retail sales up.1% month overmonth. That was weaker than expected up2%. And they did revise this up to 1.7% where the initial report that we had it was up 1.4%. Then you take out automobiles up.1% weaker than the half a percent they had expected. The last was again revised up here which could be healthy. Retail sales are when they're strong that's a good thing for the economy. They were up8% in the revised number. The jobless claim still kind of coming in about where we have been. We're back down in a little bit lower range right now at 229,000. They expected 226,000. So that's more than what was expected. But this mid 220 level, this is what we've been seeing week after week after week after week. We bumped up there a few weeks back and now we've kind of come back down into this range. And the continuing claims are at 1.881 million. And I have charts for that. Empire State Manufacturing came in at a minus 9.2. They expected it to come in at 1. Last time it was at minus 8.1. Philadelphia Fed, more regional. It came in at minus4. They expected it to be at -6. Little better than what was expected. Well, last time we had this really bad reading at minus 26.4. Total industrial production was unchanged on a month-over-month basis. They expected it to be up.3%. Which is what we had last time. Capacity utilization, it's that 80% level. How our companies using all of the facilities that are available to them were considered to be at full capacity when we're at 80%. It's coming in at 77.7 and that was a little weaker than the 77.9 but up, excuse me, but down from the 77.8 8 that we saw last time there. On a year-over-year basis, industrial production is growing 1 a.5%. Capacity utilization is at 1.9% and this is a long-term average that we use to get that. Okay, so some charts PPI first of all we look at the rate of change over the last 12 months actually coming down a little bit. So the market kind of likes that. But you look at the month over month it came back up to the unchanged level core. This is the inflation part starting to tick up a bit here with the year-over-year comparison and the month-over-month comparison. When you look at final demand on a year-over-year basis, it's actually declining. And so, the market's liking this coming closer down to that 2% level with the blue line. And then we're seeing the core, this is the inflation part that's coming down just a bit there. And final demand, looking at goods, that's in blue, which we're seeing a decline. And services on a year-over-year basis are declining. And then processed versus unprocessed. We have the processed in blue. That's pretty much flat. Where the unprocessed that is also coming down but still slightly above zero. Then retail sales starting to flatten out here. And that's what we want to keep an eye on. And probably for Monday's video, I'll show you another chart that we usually get after retail sales come out. And it shows that retail sales have a tendency to really flatten out before we go into a recession. Now, that's just one chart. We can't draw a conclusion just based on that. But it is typical of what we see sometimes. And on a month-over-month basis, much weaker than what we saw in the previous report. Then jobless claims still coming back down into this range even though the four-week moving average is still going up, but we're pretty much rangebound here. This is suggesting there's not a real problem with people filing for filing for firsttime unemployment. And we're still kind of leveling out here a little bit with the 4-week moving average with the continuing claims, but still pretty much rangebound when you look at this more in a historical context. So we have the initial claims in red, the continuing claims in blue, and then the latest unemployment at 4.2% that we had a few weeks back. And then industrial production also leveling out here. both the blue line with production and then the yellow line is capacity utilization and then we look at capacity utilization itself and again we're still underneath that 78% level. You notice here that when we get to 80% this is pretty much when it tops out but the fact that it's coming down just shows that capacity is going down a little bit as far as what's being produced. Then month over month we saw a decline with the industrial production but a less of a decline than what we saw last time. The Empire State manufacturing getting a little bit more negative reading and it's been negative now for the last few months. Philadelphia Fed less negative but still negative from the previous reading. housing market. NAHB index here shows this actually coming down after it's been declining for the most part after it had been really going up. All right, so there's that. So then we look at the bullish sentiment here. This is put out by real investment advice where we had been really negative down here and we're actually showing some improvement. Now this is before Thursday's session. So, this still has more room to run to the upside, but it's not necessarily going to go straight up. I mean, we might have some bumps along the way, even when we're looking more positive. We look at the overall trend of what's actually happening here. And looking at valuation here, we have the US, we're back above that 20 level. We use the 10, 15, 20 PE ratio scale. So we're starting to get expensive again after we had come down to about 20 and then for a few days we were even below 20 on a forward-looking basis. And it just shows when you compare it to the rest of the world how US stocks are still more expensive. Then weekly announced buybacks where this again there the blue line this is the threemon it's actually coming down just a little bit but this was a record reading from what we've actually seen before. and then compares it up with the amount of the announced buyback itself. And this is considered to be a positive thing. The forward PE multiple coming in over 20 now with the S&P where the modeled and I have no idea what the model is based on at Goldman Sachs here. They're coming in at 20.4 still above that 20 level. Then S&P 500 catches up with earnings estimates. It depends on your perspective. And I'm not quite sure what blended forward earnings per share is. What do they what kind of a blender do they use to make this up? So, but when you look at this historically, we're underneath the blue line and we're starting to come back up to that. But other things that we look at actually show earnings as being positive, but as we get closer to those earnings being reality, they start to revise those down. and uh US tariff rate and implied rate based on latest announcements. Again, this is just all guesswork here and what it's actually going to impact here with what how this is going to have an impact on the US. Okay. And then fund flows. We're seeing a lot of money coming out of the US right now because as I have been showing is that international stocks have been outperforming US stocks in 2025. This might suggest that's about ready to change because we're seeing money coming out of the US and money going into the rest of the world stocks. And usually about the time people catch on to that happening, that's about when we see a shift. Now, it can the party can still go on for a little while longer, but we'll see because this is the folks are getting um frustrated with the US stock market just not really going anywhere right now. I mean, we went down, now we're starting to come back up. But that freaked out a lot of people where they look at Europe, they look at Asia, and now with the ability of the availability of mutual funds and ETFs, you can just switch over to some kind of an international ETF or mutual fund and it's a lot easier to do things that way. Okay, let's see. Apparently, there was the same chart there. So, earnings per share growth estimate where as of the Magnificent 7 as of May 8th here, so this is a little bit older. We are still seeing that they're carrying the bulk of the earnings per share estimate as far as growth where we are going down with the light blue line. That's the rest of the S&P 500 and then the S&P 500 itself. I mean it's still now this could easily you could look at this chart and go, \"Oh my gosh, we're negative.\" But no, look over on the left hand side. Even though these are coming down, they're still positive. They're just being revised down from the higher numbers that we were seeing earlier on.

We just kind of danced along there for a while and then finally we saw some buying coming in. Took us back above the daily pivot and the unchanged level which were pretty much equal to each other. We got above R1. We made it all the way up to R2 and this is where we set the high. That's why I put those charts on the YouTube community tab. So, this was not a real mystery here. And then we bounced back down. We chopped above and below R1 and then closed right above R1. And seeing things pretty much unchanged right now in the initial overnight session, but we were seeing a gradual improvement before the market opened on Thursday. But then you can see here we we did come up, but most of the strength was actually in the the cash session part of the day and we're still looking good here. We're we're seeing growth taking a bit of a hit on our end of day charts, but intraday we still see the blue line above the red line and that's what we want. When the blue line is above, that's when the market tends to go up. When the blue line is below, that's when the market tends to go down. And we did take a bit of a hit here in the S&P growth to value ratio. It's coming down but the bigger picture is that we are still going up overall. Then the end of day charts where growth was down value was up and it was up less for the midcaps and up less for the small caps. So coming down a little bit with our end of day chart with small cap growth to value, midcap growth to value and ticking down with S&P growth to value and coming back down after we were really seeing some strength here with this growth to value ETF ratio and ticking back down with discretionary to staples. So we're but we're still above both of the moving averages here. Then as far as our trend, we are in a trend now in the short term. We crossed above the moving average. That means a strengthening trend. When it becomes confirmed is when we go above 20. And we're not there yet in the short or even intermediate term. But we are positive because the green line is above the red line. And this is the intermediate term one, the one that I focus on. It's really hard to see here. We're just barely above the moving average. You can see the ADX is coming in at 19.19 1919 where the moving average is at 1898. So, we're just a little bit above it here. So, what would make this confirmed is if the ADX goes back above 20 and we're picking up a little bit here with volume, but we're still below average. We had a couple of above average volume days, but for the most part, we're seeing volume dropping off. We are under 20 with the VIX, so that's when we see the more positive annualized returns. And we tick down a little bit here with the VIX of the VIX both with the bar chart and the line chart. The momentum of the VIX continues to be down. That's positive for stocks. We declined with this fear gauge and we just barely tick down here with this other fear gauge. So there is some fear that's coming out of the market based on different charts that are followed here. And we finally saw an improvement. They're still negative with the individual investors. the survey that came out and this is almost a week old now but they're they're getting a little more positive on things where they had spent 10 weeks is it 10 or 11 I lost count after a while where they were extremely pessimistic and usually we use that as a contrarian indicator and the fact that they were just camp down here but we weren't getting any confirmation from other charts that we were starting to go back up we although we did come down and hit support back in April and we've been bouncing ing up from that support since that time. It came down a little bit here with the risk on to risk off ratio. Again, it was an upday for the S&P, but to see this coming down, little bit of weakness coming in right now. We saw the equity put call ratio daily chart go up, but we're still we're getting extreme here with the 5-day chart, and we're still declining with the 10day chart. And we're still below the band here with volatility risk premium. So, that's still coming in rather low. the advanced decline line we ticked up. Not quite setting a new all-time high here based on price. We are setting a new all-time high based on volume. That's positive. And that's just showing that the advanced decline right now for the S&P is fairly strong and we're coming back up. But after being extreme with our advancers decliners over 10 days, we had been falling down here. And we still have more room to go to the upside with this chart. But the fact that it we're we're going up with the S&P and this didn't show more of an improvement is a little bit of a concern, but it did improve. All right. And we're still positive here with the short and intermediate term advanced decline ratio. This is where we're starting to see a little bit of weakness here. Fewer new highs, but we're not really seeing an expansion of the new lows, but it's enough to start causing our 5day moving average to go down. And we're leveling out here with our 10day moving average. We are positive with smart money indicator number one. We're above an advancing moving average with accumulation distribution. We're positive with the chaken money flow. And we're positive coming up to this red line here with the chaken oscillator. We start to really watch this more closely. We really get more concerned if we work our way up to this green line. And this is interesting. An upday for the S&P and the green line came down with the vortex. We're still positive though with the green line above the red line. And we're looking okay here with the advanced decline line studies above the moving averages with all the different indexes. Starting to get extreme with those stocks in the S&P above their 20 period moving averages. That's shortterm. And we are back to looking a little better with the 50 period, 100 period, and 200 period moving average studies. They're all above 50 now. So they're considered to be positive. the daily chart. One thing that was encouraging is we were finally able to break above this previous pivot point here, which was acting as overhead resistance. The fact that we could close above that, that's good. That's a positive sign there. We're starting to get extreme with the 20 period exponential moving average just on the S&P itself. We're above 50 and advancing with the 50 period moving average study. And we're also above 50 and advancing with the 200 period moving average study. So that that's positive there. And then we have our usual charts. The Stoke RSI just shows the upward momentum is there. The winds percent are also extreme. The CCI14 and the CCI 20. The stochastics extreme across all the three subdivisions of the short-term time frame. And we actually came down a little bit with the force index on an update, but it's still positive. And we're looking okay here with the short-term trend. We're above the green line and the blue line. And both lines are going up. That's positive. And we're above the 20 period simple and exponential moving averages with the blue line above the red line. The blue line is an exponential moving average and it moves faster than the red line which is a simple moving average. And when this is when the blue line is above the red line, that just means that the we're seeing some momentum here on a moving average basis. But we're looking extreme again here with the rate of change going back 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days. This is on the border of being short to somewhat intermediate term. So, we've seen a real move up here. And we're at the plus three channel with the standard deviations chart. That's when we go wait a minute here. But when we're really positive, we can run like if you look back almost a year ago, we were up in the plus three channel as the market was continuing to go up. So it's not necessarily a warning sign, but it just means that maybe we're going up pretty far pretty fast. Intermediate term ticking back up still above zero with the balance of power. The shorter term to intermediate term trend analysis has this looking positive. We're still extreme with the CMBB composite. We're positive with the go no-go with the blue bars. And we're at the blue line here with the highest high value and the midpoint still going up. That's positive. We're positive with the Landry light. We're positive with proper order. That's now turned green. TTM squeeze really high reading here. In fact, a higher reading than what we've seen and on this chart. And that's a little bit of a concern there. And we are moving again here. The standard deviation chart is picking that up. And we're declining but positive with the ease of movement. The Aroon it's now back up and looking extreme positive here based with the buyers where the sellers are extreme negative. And so when you look at the oscillator here it's coming back up and giving us a pretty extreme reading. And now again we're wondering is weakness coming in here? We're we're going up with the S&P and this the Mlullen oscillator did improve, but it it not as strong as you would necessarily think it would be on the update that we had. But when you take a longer term look, the summation index based on price and volume are positive. Also seeing a little bit of a negative divergence here with the NYSE Mlullen oscillator didn't really tick up all that much, but it went up. And so we're going up with the summation index based on price and volume. We're still declining. Now, we were getting a mixed picture after Wednesday. We're now seeing more confirmation. We're declining based on price and volume with the swelling treading oscillator, but momentum is positive with the PMO. We're positive based on price and volume. We're starting to get extreme with the PMOs that are rising. We're back up slightly above this green line, which is at 80. And we're coming in at 81 with this indicator turning back up, but not quite extreme with the buy signals. And we do see an improvement here with the PMOs that are above zero. But we've gone from positive to neutral. Okay, so the Elders impulse system is okay, we had an up day. Why did we go over to neutral? It's picking up a little bit of weakness here, but the parabolic S is still positive. We're getting even more extreme with the slope oscillator and we're coming up and you could make a case that we're getting extreme with the MACD. So, we're really extreme with the slope oscillator, positive with the other short-term oscillator, the TSI. Then our three intermediate term oscillators with the MACD possibly getting extreme there. We're also at positive with the TRIXS and KST, which are longer term oscillators. rolling over here looking positive. It looks like it's slowing down a bit with the Copic curve. But when you look at this in the context of a longer term chart, this is still starting to get rather extreme positive. We are positive with the Shan trend meter. We remain in the green area, but it was pretty much flat on Thursday on balance volume. Now, this is an older indicator. It was developed by Joseph Granville back in the 60s. The the drawback to this indicator is if we have an up day, all the volume is counted as positive. If we have a down day, all the volume is counted as negative. The reason why I show this is so many of the indicators that we look at here are based on on balance volume and it's been around a long time. So, a lot of people use this. Now, when we're going up the way we are and we're above the red line, which is a moving average, and the moving average is going up, that is more positive. money flow above 50, but it was pretty much flat. And we're starting to almost get extreme with the ultimate oscillator, but it's positive. And we're extreme with the short-term RSI. We're above the 70 level, and we're just below the 70 level with the more intermediate term RSI. And then, just to show you now, one thing that I get criticized for from time to time is analysis paralysis that I show so many charts. No, that's not my approach. I I use a consensus where I'm looking at everything together and then saying, \"Okay, what is the big picture telling us about what's happening rather than just relying on one or two indicators?\" When I first started out decades ago, that's what I did. And all these indicators at some point failed. And then when I switched over to looking at the bigger picture, that really changed everything. And I had a much better take on what was happening in the market. And that's what I teach in the program that I have. Well, this is the RSI 14 put out by Bloomberg here. And people are looking at this going, \"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I better make a decision.\" Well, it just says it's near an overbought zone. It doesn't actually become overbought. It it can go above this 70 level. It's not an overbought signal until it ends up coming back down below 70 again. All right. Then here's the condition of the intermediate term trend. We are seeing the exponential, the triple exponential moving above the blue. That's showing strength in the intermediate term. And we're above the 50 period simple and exponential moving averages with the exponential moving average going above the simple moving average. And we're finally leaving a little bit of real estate behind price and the 100 day simple moving average. That's been reclaimed. And all of our moving averages, we are above them. And the longer we stay up here, the more these lines, the more these lines will continue to go up. But we're way far away from the 20 and 50 period moving averages as measured by the boom indicator. And we actually declined a little bit. This is another weak weakness potential that's coming in to have an upday. Growth didn't do all that well. The mega caps didn't do all that well. And we're seeing the bullish percent index declining, actually starting to drop below its moving average after giving us an extreme reading. That's another warning sign. And we tick down just a little bit with the NYSE bullish percent index and a little bit after being really extreme with the NASDAQ 100 bullish percent index. Now, we're above the Ichimoku cloud. I call this the itchy and scratchy cloud sometimes, but that's positive. We're above this area. The longer we stay above it, the more positive it will be. Also, we see the green line going up. That's shortterm. And we see the blue line above the red line. And all of these lines are going up. So, this chart is showing a lot of improvement. And we're still above this longer term pivot point here. And we've been able to capture that. And so, if if we end up having a positive week, which it looks like we might have, unless we have a really big down day on Friday, this chart is going to show even more improvement longer term. So on a trending basis with the hike and ashy were positive the keiggy chart is positive the rano is positive the threeline break is positive all the different ways we look at trend are positive right now and we're improving here with the 150 and 200 period moving averages this is a concern though and this nice Midwestern family name here Zahorjack this is longterm a very long term and now for most of we came down in 2024 briefly, but then we went right back up. Now, something is going on here because we've been going back up with the S&P and this just ticked down another notch. So, a full-on buy signals at 10. We ticked down to eight. Now, we've ticked all the way down to four. So, what's happening with this chart is there's some internal longer term weakness that's being picked up. Now, there's a delay with this chart. It's dated May 14th. So this isn't taking into account the latest action here, but we'll just keep an eye on this one as well. Then we are positive in the short term with all the stock indexes and we still have the midcaps and small caps negative in the intermediate term and long term. Bonds are negative across the board on all time frames. And even though the dollar was down, it's still in a short-term uptrend according to how they measure it at stocktarts.com. and commodities are in a short-term uptrend. And we saw a discretion area. That's the growth area. We want that area to do better. It was down where we see things like utilities. And most of the time this is considered to be defensive. Although I always point this out because of AI, because of crypto mining and all the need for electricity, you could almost put utilities into a growth area. Staples a defensive area, real estate a defensive area, healthc care a defensive area. These are the areas that saw some love on Thursday where we had discretionary tech and communication. They were the worst performing areas and those are the more growth areas that we follow. So saw well kind of a mixed little Christmas look here with red and green. Utilities ended up having a MACD crossover right after the open. Real estate had a bearish MACD crossover. The Nasdaq got above 191 but then went below 191 and then got back above 192 going more into the close. Canada setting a new all-time high above 5900 with the NASDAQ. And then we're seeing a little bit of weakness here. Even though healthcare was okay, it's showing longer term weakness. Had a BPI cross below 50 and set a new 52- week low. And the Dow went below 42,000. Gold was down but then ended up being up by the end of the day. Then here's the market carpet here where when you see Nvidia and Apple red, that's when the market's really having trouble. Microsoft was up but a quarter of a percent. I mean it wasn't up all that much. And the financials green, we like that. Healthcare, this is more defensive. It went down and set a new 52- week low as a sector. And you might have seen some buying coming in there. and Staples, you had Walmart down, but most of the other bigger areas here were in green. That's more defensive. Discretionary, when you have Amazon and Tesla down, that takes the sector down with it. Communication, Google, and Meta, the biggest, they were down as well. All right. And we have the Dow still having a difficult time with its 200 day moving average here. Just can't really seem to clear that. And we're neutral with the diamonds, with the Elder Impulse system. We're above all the moving averages with the NASDAQ and showing an improvement. It ended up being down on Thursday and we've gone from positive to neutral with the NASDAQ and the NASDAQ 100, which we follow very closely because of its impact on the S&P 500. It was up just a little bit here and above both of the moving averages, was finally able to break through this resistance area. But we're neutral. We've gone from positive to neutral with the Q's with the Elders Impulse system. But the momentum for the NASDAQ 100 is positive. We're seeing a little bit of pullback now. Actually, we were up a little bit with the small caps, but it's really having a hard time getting above this R1 resistance level. It really fought to get above its 50-day moving average, and now it's having more trouble with overhead resistance. And we're coming down a little bit with the Russell 2000 small cap index. When we look at the RSI after getting extreme positive, the momentum though for the small caps are still positive but still below the 200 day moving average and small caps are still neutral with the Elders impulse system. Midcaps also having a difficult time. We see this R1 level which is overhead resistance. The midcaps have been having a difficult time with that. And when it did try to go up, it ran into resistance at its 200 day moving average. So we are neutral with the midcaps with the elders impulse system. And we were up a little bit here with the Wilshire. We're above both moving averages. That's more positive. Also, the total US stock ETF was up and above both of the moving averages as well. Financial sector was up and still in an uptrend there. The fang index was down a little bit, but it's above both moving averages. And let's see, Apple was down, still dealing with its 50-day moving average. Amazon still above both moving averages, but it was down 2.42%. Microsoft was barely up, but it's been doing well since they came out with their earnings report. And Google was down and still below its 200 day moving average. Meta is trying to give us a golden cross here, but it was down 2.35%. Nvidia in a downtrend, but back above both moving averages. and Tesla in a downtrend, but above but above both moving averages here. Netflix back to setting new all-time highs. So, yeah, putting out some good movies these days. And we're still seeing fairly strong correlation in the short term between US and world stocks. Longer term, we're seeing that correlation start to strengthen a little bit here. And oil is still in the low 60s and the dollar still above 100 even though it did decline and is still in a downtrend. And keeping an eye on inflation, this is starting to go back up here. So we'll keep an eye on this. This is true inflation. That's how they calculate inflation at 1.85%. But we did drop down below the 4 and a.5% level with the 10-year yield. So that was causing some concern after Wednesday. The fact that interest rates came down did give some support to stocks on Thursday and we're back up above the 200 day moving average with the 10-year based on price. And we're coming down a little bit. We saw a little bit of a hit taken with our growth to value ratios, but all of these the Q's to S&P discretionary S&P large cap growth to large cap value. They're still above advancing moving averages and we're above the moving averages with large caps, midcaps, and small caps. So, what's our outlook then? We are positive in the short and intermediate term as well as the long term because we're above the moving averages there. Friday will be options expiration. Now, it's not the end of the quarter, but sometimes these days can be kind of crazy. And we're going to get housing starts as well as building permits, import and export prices, and consumer sentiment. I would be focused more on housing starts and building permits because that tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator of what's going on economically and then consumer sentiment. How are people feeling about things? Is it improving or is it getting worse? And then all the geopolitical things mainly having to do with the trade wars and tariffs and negotiations that are happening and plus the president is out of the country. So you just want to keep a closer eye on things when that happens. And then here we're finishing out the economic calendar for the week. Nothing to show here. We finished up all of that and we're neutral to negative with the Dow for May 16th where we're neutral to positive with the S&P and NASDAQ. This will be the last day of options expiration week. And we tend to be down a little bit more than up. Now, unless we have a pretty big down day, we're probably going to have an up week. A lot of that has to do with the gap way back from Monday that was created then. So we still see some positive seasonality during post election years. So this can still carry on at least from a seasonal perspective. There's another newer chart. Post-election years tend to bottom in early April and then rally. All right. Well, that's kind of where we're at right now. We took a bit of a hit there in April while the world was or not the world, America was falling apart and then everyone gave it a second thought and said, \"Well, maybe it's not.\" And so, it's starting to go back up. Now, here are the pivot points which are already posted on the YouTube community tab. So, please check this out. Use this tool. It's out there. It's free. We know this ahead of time. So, that's a good thing to use. All right. So, we're still dealing with longerterm downtrends when we look at growth to value for the S&P as well as discretionary to stables. Now, both of those ratios are above their moving averages, and if they can stay above them, they would eventually lead to golden crosses, but they're still downtrends for right now. Another warning sign is the swing trading oscillator is now declining based on price and volume, and our long-term special K chart continues to be negative even though it's improving. All right, then our smart money indicators still continue to be positive for right now. And we're positive with the Mlullen oscillators and summation indexes both for the S&P and NYSE. The bullish percent indexes, we're a little concerned about the S&P. It's starting to drop below its moving average, but it's still giving us an extreme positive reading. The parabolic S is positive. We're extreme with the 20 period moving average study. We're positive with the momentum. were positive with the ease of movement, money flow, and ultimate oscillator. The vortex, even though it came down on an upday, it's still positive. And the financial sector and momentum for the NASDAQ 100 continue to be positive. With each video in course, members learn to implement the consensus approach, a unique analytical method. Unlike relying on a few indicators that eventually fail, this approach overcomes analysis paralysis by using the weight of the evidence to draw conclusions. Developed over decades across all market conditions, explore the S&P investing program and start with a 30-day free trial. Our conclusion, we are still positive in the short, intermediate, and long term. We are seeing some weakness starting to come in. Now, it could rectify itself and we could see a pick up in growth, but we're seeing some extreme readings now to the upside, extreme positive readings currently. And we're also seeing some weakness as we're overbought in the intermediate term. We are positive in the long term because we're above the 200 day moving average, but we're still dealing with a downtrend there. Thank you. I hope you found this helpful. I hope you have a really good day and I will talk to you in the next video."
