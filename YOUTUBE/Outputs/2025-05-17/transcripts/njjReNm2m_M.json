  "transcript": "Good morning everyone. It is Friday, May 16, 2025. I am John471 and this is the opening swing. Let's begin today as we always do with our news. First, I'll I will pause to read our disclaimer. Derivatives trading is not suitable for all investors. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Moving on to our news. As mentioned, today is Friday at 8:30 Eastern. We have housing starts and permits. Where is it? Right here. Housing starts and permits at 8:30. We also have uh import and export prices at the same time. At 10:00, we have the University of Michigan consumer sentiment. That's probably going to be one of our our our most important data point today. Although nothing's really that important today. We also have uh Trump on the calendar here as well as ECB's Lane and I believe Barkin. Yeah, there's Barkin, but not until later on. So, that is our news for today. Let's move on to our charts. Okay, we're just going to take a quick look at the higher time frame here. This is the S&P 500 daily bars full session. And just really big picture, what we're seeing here is just a, you know, a market that pushed to an all-time high up here, established a bit of a trading range, reverted lower. We had a big fight area here. Obviously, this is all news driven. We know that. We know that. had a big fight area here. Continued lower, seemingly found a bottom, seemingly attempted to retest, was unable, pushed through this fight area, and now we're attempting to regain this uh this upper area. That seems to be what we're attempting to do. What are the important areas here? What else can we gather from this chart besides just seeing the big picture action? Well, what we can tell here is that we are we had been one time frame higher. We broke the one time framing, but we're able to continue the tra trajectory higher. This is Friday. We're also going and we're going into uh Friday with having um you know settled higher than we opened every day this week. So that's pretty strong. Um do we have targets here? We do have targets. The key target I said for me pushing higher above the 5821s which were really our key target. We've surpassed that area. The next big area is the is the 6,000 the psychological uh 6,000 number which will get us into the uh trading range I talked about right here. Are there other intermediate targets ahead of that ahead of that price? There definitely are. There's a fairly important one. Let's discuss that on the next chart. Okay. So, here we are on a chart of the S&P 500. This is still daily bars, but this is RTH only. And what I wanted to talk about here just briefly as these four days obviously are are are our week in progress with Friday being today. And we what do we have this week? We started um we opened the week above the prior week. We tried to pull back. We found quick support and we have a been able to maintain this sort of choppy trend higher. We have uh single prints left from yesterday. Okay, it's really this this uh action is pretty interesting. You know, as I've said, we opened here, essentially opened here, tested lower, reverted higher, left a clear double distribution profile, and then just began to trend from here. You see, we pushed higher out of this. We found an an initial offer. We again tried to pull back, but the bids just bids and support just held us right here. And then yesterday obviously we we were able to uh push higher and settle higher. And the way that yesterday's profile looks to me it's just um it just it's screaming that there just is not enough for sale in this area and we need to push higher to find willing sellers. We could easily find them today. We could find them immediately. But from what happened yesterday, that's what we're seeing. That's what I'm seeing today. Um pretty clear uh this profile pretty clear LIS in my opinion. This signifies demand in my eyes. So any push into this area I would expect buyers to to step up at some point. And if they do not then I would expect all of the volume all the buyers that uh that attempted to buy there to have to have to puke out. Now, another thing, another reason I'm on this chart, I just want to show you something. I mentioned something about another target. So, what we're going to do here is just go straight to the left to the left until we get to boom. the last time we traded these prices and the last time we traded these prices were this is March 3rd this this day this is what's called our template day this is the last day we traded these prices and so what we see here is um March 3rd we have some single prints left right here these singles are important these singles they're the ones that we're just kind of pushing into and we also have um our March 3rd uh naked Vpo. This is a March 5th one. I'll have to get rid of this. This is that should be taken off. But regardless, um so this template day, we see these singles left here. We also see these singles left here, which is kind of where on this day we had buyers attempting to hold prices right here and then the flush happened and we never were able to come back. We went the whole way to the bottom from here. So for me, these single prints at 82, this is the big deal. These 82s are the big deal. We also have the yearly close for 2024 up here. And then we have Millennium. So for me today, you know, for me, if we if we're able to push higher, these single prints are really the the key area for us to be reaching for. And if we're able to get these prices, then I would expect potential stops to go off into these targets right here. If we are instead unable to get these single prints, then I could see us starting to revert lower from this area if we uh after an initial push higher. Let's go to a smaller time frame chart and plan for more specific price action. Okay, here we are on our intraday chart. Let's plan for paths that price may take. We're going to begin with bullish ideas um because that's the bias. That's the default bias for me right now. We have taken the prior day's high already and you can see that our GlobeEx session so far is giving us a double distribution profile accepting prices above the prior days high. Uh we're into those three three singles I talked about, those initial ones. We're into them and we have our final set of singles up here in the 82s. And above we have all those other good targets I talked about. Um so we'll begin with the bullish ideas. What's the most bullish idea? The most bullish idea is really if we just hold this key LVN in the overnight profile. Like if we hold the 5940s, that would be the most bullish idea. It might not give us an entry. Um if we I'll just say if we get some type of a nice pullback at some point, some volatility into uh like into yesterday's distribution here, a pullback into here that then finds support and reverts above. That would be great to get that set up. I don't know if it'll happen, but regardless, the bottom line here is if we hold the overnight low, whether we push in these singles or not. If we hold the overnight low and we push and we get up into this uh 55 zone except the um the mid-century area, then I would be open to excursion higher. If we show that we are not willing to trade price in yesterday's range, we just continue. In which case, we would just be essentially looking for the targets that I I just laid out. The first one that I that I would, you know, be looking at as a key target would be this 74 zone ahead of the uh singles, these 80s. I'm thinking there is going to be some resistance at at this, you know, waiting to sell around the 80s or above this whole area. I would expect there to be resistance. So, if we get this push, what it might look like is just kind of a push. Maybe we get this zone the first try, maybe not. But I would expect kind of a trending push higher into uh ideally to get these 82s. If we get the 82s, that would be my key target for the day. And I would not necessarily need to see any excursion beyond that. However, I'll note that if we get through the 82s and we accept prices in this 85 to 91 stock zone, that could really be a fulcrum that could push some stops. Uh, you know, trigger some stops and we might see the push into Millennium today. Uh, if we do, Millennium is the key extended target, you know, this area. We also have that naked Vpock at 66. That would be the key area if we just continue higher. All right. What happens if we get a pullback? Can we go bullish if we take the overnight low? Definitely. Because I'll tell you that if we do get some type of an initial push into this area, as I've said, like a pullback into this area, like I'm not going to just put a bid out there, but this would be a place where I would be open to seeing price push, find support, and then give some type of a clear uh setup higher. I would really in an ideal situation if something like that happens, the ideal way it could happen is seeing the push into this area, seeing the exhaustion, the the seller exhaustion happen and then getting the impulse above yesterday's uh Vpo. That would be the picture perfect way to trade it. It won't happen the picture perfect way. It never does. Um but I'm just flagging that a push into here that finds support and then reverts would be uh appetizing to me. Let's discuss ideas how the the bullish idea could be completely wrong. Well, first off, as I've said, we could get that initial bullish push towards those targets and then sellers just come in and shove us back down below first the 50s and then if we end up, you know, getting this push, get having it refuted and then getting trapped back within the prior days range, then that is going to pretend uh a potential pullback for me. And of course, I would be looking for a test of this zone, which is yesterday's Vpock. As I've just said, this is an area that could be support. But if we already get the test and everybody starts selling, then I would not be so ambitious about this support holding and instead would look for that push that I just talked about into this HVN region. Now, like I just said, this is an area where I would expect buyers to want to get interested. We might see even if we get this push what what could happen is we just sort of zipper here attempt boom revert and start going higher. That's how this could happen. However, if we see that, if we instead see us push to here, we make that probe, then it looks like we want an impulse, but we can't get back into our prior, our prior accepted area, which is the VPO, and instead we fall back below this fulcrum and start pressing 5900s, then that could start to mean that things are changing a little bit. And I would be open to, as I've said here, a test of 5,900 and potentially a retest of these 85s here, this 85 stock zone. Now, I would still expect support on on the first touch here, but I'll tell you that if we lose this 85 stock zone today and start pushing lower, that could potentially mean the environment is changing a little bit today and we might see more reversion than I think. I'm not going to be super aggressive to initiate uh shorts down here, but I will be tentative. I will be um I would be open to holding a runner. Um overall though, we have to recognize this is a pretty bullish environment we're walking into. I would really, you know, and like I said, this area this Wednesday, this to me is really looking like support. You know, any pushes into this area, I I'm tending to think that buyers are going to at least initially be interested. And for us to really start to get structurally short, we'd have to lose this area, lose this V-po and see sellers start to move from up here to down here and start to push. That's the way that I would want to that's the how I would be open to the structural short is seeing price get pushed down to here and seeing the sellers follow it and keep pushing from this area. Anyway, all right, that's what I got for you. We're not going to do crude. Crude's in the process of rolling to July. Things get a little bit weird when products roll. I tend to let them stay away for a day or day or two. Um, this is what I have for the S&Ps. If there are any questions, please ask me in the chat room. I hope that this is helpful. I hope it's complete. I also hope that you uh hit that like button and potentially even subscribe because that really uh gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside. And so, you know, why not? Why not uh why not do good things on a Friday? Help us get to 10,000. But uh any questions, ask me in the chat room. Hopefully, this is helpful. And uh I hope you're having a great morning. I hope your great morning continues. And I hope that you find some way to improve your trading today that does not depend on your P&L. And then you just end and go off into a great weekend. That's what I got, guys. Have a great day. Let's get out there and clock those ticks. Ciao."
