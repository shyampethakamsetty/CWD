Welcome to the Daily Update podcast where I'll go over the action in the market for Friday, May 16th, and we'll see how things look for Monday, May 19th. Recapping what happened on Friday, the S&P extended its upward trajectory with the S&P closing up 7% at its intraday high despite below average volume on options expiration day. Prices opened higher, fluctuated around the unchanged level, broke above the R1 pivot at 5939, encountered resistance at 5950, dipped, and then rallied to close just below R2 at 5961. The S&P remains above its 20, 50, and 200 day moving averages, signaling strength across short, intermediate, and long-term trends. The Dow also turned positive year to date, aligning with the S&P's bullish momentum. Looking over key indicators and observations, momentum remains robust. Short-term indicators such as the Stoke RSI, Williams percent, CCI indicators, and stochastics alongside intermediate term indicators such as the MACD, TTM squeeze, and Mlullen oscillator reflect strong bullish sentiment. However, many are nearing overbought territory. Negative divergences in the NYSC Mlullen oscillator and bullish percent indexes suggest not all market segments are keeping pace with the S&P strength. Extreme readings, including the VIX, RSI, short-term advanced decline ratio, and 86.4% of stocks being above their 20 period moving average in the S&P further highlight overbought conditions. Notably, below average volume on options expiration day indicates a lack of strong conviction behind the price gains. Switching over to economic and external factors. After the close on Friday, Moody's downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to double A1, citing rising government debt and fiscal deficits projected to widen from 6.4% to 9% of GDP. The markets couldn't react, but this may impact the futures when they open Sunday evening and into the open on Monday. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.44% below the critical 4.5% threshold. Economic data disappointed with housing starts at 1.361 million against 1.383 million expected. Building permits at 1.412 million versus 1.45 45 million anticipated and consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 below the expected reading of 55. Import and export prices showed minimal changes with no clear tariff effects yet. Ongoing trade war and tariff uncertainties persist though market optimism prevails as evidenced by the bullish chart patterns. Going through sector and stock performance, defensive sectors, which include healthcare, utilities, real estate, and staples led the market on Friday, while discretionary, communication, and tech lagged. Financials and industrial showed resilience, but energy was the sole sector to decline. Among mega caps, Apple dipped slightly, Microsoft and Nvidia gained modestly, Tesla rose over 2%, and Netflix set another all-time high. Looking at market breath, advanced decline lines for the S&P 500 and NYC reached new highs with volume leading price, a bullish sign. New highs expanded and new lows contracted, supporting the rally. However, a slight weakening in the 10day advanced decline average hints at potential short-term fragility. Now looking at sentiment and volatility. Market sentiment is positive at 71 but nearing the overbought threshold of 75. The VIX and related fear gauges continue to decline reflecting reduced market fear though some are at extreme negative levels signaling excessive optimism. The market remains in a short-term uptrend though not yet confirmed with the ADX trend indicator still below 20. Long-term downtrends persist in the growth to value and discretionary to staples ratios. Looking ahead to Monday, May 19th, the economic calendar is light in the upcoming week. Monday brings the leading economic index, followed by the weekly mortgage applications on Wednesday, jobless claims on Thursday, as well as housing data that will come later in the week. Seasonally, May 19th has historically been negative for the Dow, S&P, and NASDAQ, though the week following options expiration is positive 66% of the time. What are some key factors to watch? The market's reaction to Moody's downgrade, particularly in the futures market and bond markets, developments in the trade wars, tariffs, and any geopolitical events, whether overbought conditions trigger a slowdown or a minor pullback. Considering the technical bias, the market maintains a positive bias across short, intermediate, and long-term horizons. Pivot points and moving averages suggest continued support, but overbought signals, and negative divergences warrant caution. A consolidation or minor pullback is possible, though the broader uptrend remains intact for now. In conclusion, the market's resilience continues to defy expectations of exhaustion fueled by strong and improving technicals and optimism about economic prospects. However, overbought conditions, negative divergences, and external risks such as the Moody's downgrade and trade uncertainties call for vigilance. As we head into Monday, investors should monitor the futures for early signs and stay tuned to macroeconomic developments. I hope you found this podcast helpful.
