  "transcript": "Welcome to the Daily Update podcast where I'll go over the action in the market for Thursday, May 15th, and we'll see how things look for Friday, May 16th. Going over a market summary of what happened on Thursday, the S&P 500 delivered a resilient performance despite a shaky start. The index opened lower below its S1 pivot point at 5874, pressured by negative futures. However, dip buying throughout the session drove a recovery with the S&P closing up 41% just above the R1 daily pivot level. Notably, trading volume was below average, signaling cautious participation. The S&P 500 broke above the key 5900 psychological level, which now serves as potential support if prices begin to drop, but faced resistance at the R2 pivot of 5925. Despite the daily gain, weakness in mega caps, semis, and growth sectors hinted at short-term fatigue. Defensive sectors, including utilities, staples, real estate, and healthcare outperformed, while tech, communication, and discretionary lagged. The financials held positive, but the Dow, small caps, and midcaps struggled at their respective 200day moving averages. From a technical perspective, the S&P 500 remains positive across the short, intermediate, and long-term time frames, trading above its 20, 50, and 200 day moving averages. However, a long-term downtrend persists, and several indicators are flashing caution. Short-term indicators such as the Stoke RSI, Williams percentar, and CCI indicators are at extreme positive levels, reflecting positive momentum, but are at overbought conditions. Intermediate term signals, including the CMBB composite and bullish percent index, also shows an extreme positive reading with the S&P 500's bullish percent index dipping below its moving average on an upday, a potential warning sign. Long-term, the Zahorch indicator dropped to four from eight, highlighting internal weakness. Longer term, the VIX remained below 20, a bullish sign for stocks, and the advanced decline line is strong. However, fewer new highs and a leveling 10day moving average suggests momentum may be slowing. The 10-year yield eased from 4.53% to 4.46%, dipping below the critical 4.5 threshold. This supported equities. Numerous economic reports were released on Thursday, producing some inflation concerns after the PPI fell half a percent against expectations of a rise of.3% though prior months were revised upward. Core PPI which excludes food and energy dropped 4% missing the expected.3% gain. Retail sales rose a modest.1% below the anticipated rise of2%. Jobless claims came in at 229,000 slightly above the forecast of 226,000 with continuing claims at 1.881 million. Manufacturing disappointed with the Empire State Manufacturing Index at - 9.2 versus an expected +1 and the Philadelphia Fed index at -4. though better than the anticipated reading of minus6. Industrial production was flat, missing the expected.3% increase and capacity utilization remains subdued at 77.7. Market sentiment stayed positive but edged lower, dropping to 69 from 70. A sense of FOMO or the fear of missing out continues to drive gains with investors chasing recent rallies. However, high valuations with the S&P 500's forward PE above 20 and geopolitical uncertainties such as potential tariffs, trade wars, and President Trump's Middle East trip introduce risks. Despite these factors, the market's euphoric mood remains intact for now. Looking ahead to Friday, May 16th, the market carries a neutral to positive bias for the S&P and Nasdaq, but a neutral to negative outlook for the Dow. Options expiration could spark volatility particularly in the afternoon session. Key economic releases include housing starts, building permits, import export prices, and consumer sentiment with housing and sentiment data likely to influence market direction. Seasonally, post-election years often see rallies following an early April bottom, which supports the potential for continued upside. Technically, traders should monitor pivot points available on the YouTube community tab for this channel with 5900 acting as potential support for the S&P 500. Growth to value and discretionary to staples ratios remain in downtrends but are holding above their moving averages, suggesting a mixed sector outlook. Looking at the key risks and opportunities, while lower interest rates and defensive sector strength provide a tailwind, risks are mounting. Overbought conditions, fading growth stock momentum, and geopolitical uncertainties could trigger a near-term pullback. Investors should remain vigilant as extreme technical readings and high valuations signal caution. In conclusion, Thursday's market showed resilience with the S&P 500 climbing 41% despite early weakness and below average volume. Defensive sectors led while growth stocks lagged and technical indicators are flashing overbought warnings. The market remains positive across all time frames, but short-term fatigue and external risks warrant caution. For Friday, expect potential volatility from options expiration and focus on the housing and sentiment data that will be released. While the seasonal backdrop supports gains, overbought conditions and geopolitical uncertainties could cap the upside. I hope you found this podcast helpful.
